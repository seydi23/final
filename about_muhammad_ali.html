		<h3> Bio </h3>
		<p>In Louisville, Kentucky, during the 1940s and 1950s, racial segregation permeated every aspect of daily life. Despite the oppressive environment, young Cassius Clay showed remarkable resilience and determination. He witnessed the indignities suffered by African-Americans in his community and felt the sting of discrimination himself. These early experiences left an indelible mark on his psyche, shaping his understanding of social justice and inequality.
			As he matured, Cassius Clay became increasingly aware of the systemic barriers that held back Black individuals from achieving their full potential. His encounters with bigotry and prejudice fueled a growing sense of outrage and a desire to challenge the status quo. It was within this crucible of adversity that the seeds of his future activism were planted.
			Cassius Clay's journey from a segregated upbringing to becoming Muhammad Ali, the outspoken champion of civil rights and humanitarian causes, is a testament to the transformative power of personal conviction and resilience in the face of injustice. His life serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration for generations to come, reminding us all of the importance of standing up for what is right, even in the face of overwhelming opposition.
		<h3> Boxing journey </h3>
		<p>Ali's introduction to boxing was serendipitous, sparked by a childhood incident that would alter the course of his life. At the tender age of 12, after his beloved bicycle was pilfered, a determined young Cassius Clay sought justice. His encounter with the police officer, Joe Martin, was a fateful twist of fate. Little did he know that this chance meeting would ignite a passion and unearth a talent that would define him for years to come.
		Martin recognized something special in Clay's fiery spirit and offered him an invitation that would change everything. The dusty gym where punches echoed against the walls became Clay's sanctuary, and under Martin's watchful eye, he honed his skills with fervor and dedication.
		With each jab and hook, Clay's confidence swelled, and his prowess became undeniable. His rise in the amateur ranks was meteoric, a testament to his natural ability and unwavering work ethic. Six Kentucky Golden Gloves titles, two National Golden Gloves titles, and an Amateur Athletic Union national title were but stepping stones on his path to greatness.
		The pinnacle of Clay's amateur career came on the world stage at the 1960 Rome Olympics. In the ring, he danced like a butterfly and stung like a bee, dazzling spectators with his speed and agility. When the final bell tolled, it was Clay's hand that was raised in victory, adorned with the coveted gold medal in the light heavyweight division.</p>
		<h3> Name change </h3>
		<p>After basking in the glory of his Olympic triumph, Clay embarked on a new chapter in his boxing journey, transitioning from the amateur ranks to the unforgiving world of professional boxing. With his lightning-fast footwork and mesmerizing combination of speed and power, he quickly captured the imagination of fans and pundits alike.
		But it wasn't just his skills in the ring that set him apart; it was his larger-than-life personality and unapologetic confidence that truly made him stand out. Clay was a master of self-promotion, often rhyming and boasting about his prowess in a manner that was as captivating as it was controversial.
		In 1964, the young brash boxer faced off against the formidable Sonny Liston, the reigning heavyweight champion of the world. Despite being the underdog, Clay exuded an air of unshakeable confidence, boldly predicting that he would "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee." And true to his word, Clay delivered a stunning upset, dethroning Liston and claiming the heavyweight crown at the tender age of 22.
		But Clay's victory in the ring was just the beginning of a profound transformation. Shortly after his triumph, he publicly announced his conversion to Islam and embraced the teachings of the Nation of Islam. In a bold and defiant move, he shed his birth name, Cassius Clay, denouncing it as a relic of a painful past marked by slavery and oppression. From that moment on, he would be known as Muhammad Ali, a name imbued with spiritual significance and a powerful declaration of his newfound identity.
		Ali's decision to embrace Islam and adopt a new name was met with a mix of admiration and controversy. Some hailed him as a trailblazer for his courage in asserting his beliefs, while others viewed his conversion with suspicion and hostility. But for Ali, the name change was more than just a symbolic gesture; it was a reaffirmation of his commitment to his faith and his determination to forge his own path, unburdened by the expectations and prejudices of others.
		</p>
		<h3> Boxing career highlights </h3>
		<p>As Muhammad Ali's star continued to rise in the boxing world, so did the caliber of his opponents. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Ali faced a series of formidable challengers who tested his skills, his resolve, and his legacy as one of the greatest heavyweight champions of all time.
		Among his most memorable adversaries was Joe Frazier, a relentless fighter known for his relentless aggression and devastating left hook. Their first encounter, dubbed the "Fight of the Century," took place in 1971 at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The anticipation leading up to the bout was palpable, with both men holding legitimate claims to the title of heavyweight champion. In a brutal, back-and-forth battle, Ali and Frazier traded blows for 15 grueling rounds, leaving fans and critics alike in awe of their courage and determination. Ultimately, Frazier emerged victorious, handing Ali his first professional defeat and cementing their rivalry as one of the most storied in boxing history.
		But Ali's journey was far from over. Undeterred by his setback, he continued to pursue greatness, reclaiming the heavyweight title in a dramatic showdown with George Foreman in 1974. The fight, known as the "Rumble in the Jungle," took place in Kinshasa, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), and pitted Ali against the fearsome Foreman, whose raw power and ferocious style had made him the most feared man in boxing. Against all odds, Ali employed a daring strategy, employing his famous "rope-a-dope" tactic to tire out Foreman and ultimately secure a stunning victory by knockout in the eighth round.				But perhaps the most iconic chapter in Ali's rivalry with Frazier came in 1975, with their third and final encounter, the "Thrilla in Manila." In scorching temperatures and under the glare of the Philippine sun, Ali and Frazier engaged in a brutal, toe-to-toe battle that pushed both men to the brink of exhaustion. The fight, which Ali famously described as "the closest thing to dying," culminated in the 14th round when Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, made the agonizing decision to throw in the towel, conceding victory to Ali. It was a fitting end to their epic trilogy and a testament to the enduring legacy of two of boxing's greatest warriors.
		Through his epic battles with Frazier, Foreman, and a host of other formidable opponents, Muhammad Ali solidified his place in boxing history as a true champion, both iside and outside the ring. His fights weren't just spectacles of skill and athleticism; they were tests of character and resolve, showcasing his indomitable spirit and unyielding determination to be the best. And though his career may have ended in the ring, his legacy lives on as an enduring symbol of courage, conviction, and the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity.</p>
		<h3> Draft evasion </h3>
		<p>In 1967, as the Vietnam War raged on, Muhammad Ali faced a defining moment that would not only shape his career but also solidify his status as a symbol of resistance and conviction. When called upon to serve in the military, Ali, guided by his deeply-held religious beliefs as a devout Muslim and his moral opposition to the war, refused to be drafted into the armed forces.
		His decision to conscientiously object to the war and his refusal to take part in what he viewed as an unjust conflict led to a firestorm of controversy. Despite facing intense backlash from the government, media, and public opinion, Ali remained resolute in his stance. In his famous declaration, he boldly proclaimed, "I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong," articulating his belief that the war was not in alignment with his principles of peace and justice.
		As a result of his refusal to comply with the draft, Ali was stripped of his heavyweight title, banned from boxing, and faced the threat of imprisonment. However, even in the face of such dire consequences, Ali stood firm in his convictions, willing to sacrifice everything for what he believed to be right.
		His legal battle ensued, culminating in a landmark Supreme Court decision in 1971. In a unanimous ruling, the highest court in the land overturned Ali's conviction for draft evasion, vindicating his stance and affirming his constitutional rights. With this pivotal victory, Ali was finally able to return to the ring and resume his boxing career.
		Ali's principled stand against the Vietnam War and his unwavering commitment to his beliefs transformed him into a symbol of defiance and moral courage. His refusal to compromise his integrity in the face of adversity inspired millions around the world and cemented his legacy not only as a boxing legend but also as a champion of social justice and human rights. Through his actions, Ali demonstrated the profound impact that one individual can have in standing up for what is right, even in the face of overwhelming opposition.</p>
		<h3> Social advocacy </h3>
		<p>
		Beyond the boxing ring, Muhammad Ali's impact reverberated across the globe as he emerged as a towering figure in the fight for civil rights and social justice. His voice, once amplified by his athletic prowess, now echoed even louder as he used his platform to confront the injustices of his time.
		Ali fearlessly tackled issues of racism, inequality, and war, becoming a powerful advocate for change. With eloquence and passion, he spoke out against the systemic oppression faced by African-Americans, challenging societal norms and demanding equal rights and dignity for all.
		His principled stance against the Vietnam War, rooted in his religious and moral convictions, resonated with millions around the world. By refusing to serve, Ali courageously defied the establishment and brought attention to the human cost of war, inspiring a generation of activists and conscientious objectors.
		In addition to his vocal activism, Ali also dedicated himself to philanthropic endeavors aimed at making a positive impact on society. He embarked on humanitarian missions to Africa, where he championed causes such as education, healthcare, and economic empowerment for underserved communities.
		Furthermore, Ali's personal struggles with Parkinson's disease, diagnosed in 1984, only fueled his commitment to helping others. Despite facing his own health challenges, he tirelessly raised awareness and funds for research into the debilitating neurological disorder, using his influence to support charities dedicated to finding a cure and improving the lives of those affected.</p>
		<h3>Legacy</h3>
		<p>Muhammad Ali's passing on June 3, 2016, marked the end of an era, but his impact and influence endure as a beacon of hope and inspiration for people around the world. His legacy transcends the boundaries of time, race, and nationality, resonating with individuals from all walks of life and inspiring future generations to emulate his example.
		Ali's unwavering commitment to his principles, his fearless advocacy for civil rights and social justice, and his relentless pursuit of excellence in the face of adversity continue to inspire millions. His life story serves as a reminder that one person's courage and conviction can ignite positive change on a global scale.
		In a world marked by division and inequality, Ali's message of unity, compassion, and understanding remains as relevant as ever. He challenged the status quo, broke down barriers, and brought people together through the power of his words and actions.
		Beyond his achievements in the boxing ring, Ali's legacy lies in his ability to touch hearts and minds, sparking a movement of empowerment and activism that reverberates through the generations.
