				<p>Muhammad Ali's career is filled with numerous highlights that solidify his status as one of the greatest athletes of all time. Here are some of his most memorable career moments</p>
				<h4>1960 Olympic Gold Medal</h4>
				<p>In the summer of 1960, amidst the grandeur of the Rome Olympics, a young Cassius Clay stepped into the ring with determination blazing in his eyes. At just 18 years old, he possessed a talent and drive that belied his age. In the light heavyweight division, he danced like a butterfly and stung like a bee, outmaneuvering and outclassing his opponents with speed and finesse.
				With each punch thrown, Clay's destiny seemed to unfold before the eyes of the world. His lightning-fast jabs and nimble footwork captured the attention of spectators and judges alike. Match after match, he emerged victorious, his confidence growing with every bout.
				Finally, in the gold medal match, Clay faced his toughest challenge yet. Across the ring stood a formidable opponent, but Clay refused to be intimidated. With the weight of his dreams resting on his shoulders, he fought with heart and determination, leaving no doubt in the minds of the judges.
				When the final bell rang, Cassius Clay's arm was raised in triumph, a gold medal adorning his chest. The world witnessed the birth of a legend that day, as Cassius Clay took his first step towards becoming the greatest boxer the world had ever seen. The 1960 Olympic gold medal was not just a symbol of victory, but a harbinger of the greatness that was yet to come.</p>
				<h4>1964: Defeating Sonny Liston for the World Heavyweight Title</h4>
				<p>In 1964, the world of boxing was rocked to its core as a brash young fighter by the name of Cassius Clay faced off against the reigning heavyweight champion, Sonny Liston. Clay, just 22 years old at the time, possessed a confidence that bordered on audacity. He taunted Liston in the lead-up to the fight, proclaiming to anyone who would listen that he would 'float like a butterfly, sting like a bee,' and that Liston 'must fall in five!'
				The bout was shrouded in controversy and anticipation. Liston, a menacing figure in the ring with a fearsome reputation, was expected to dispatch Clay with ease. But Clay, fueled by his unshakeable self-belief and unparalleled skill, had other plans.
				From the opening bell, Clay dazzled with his speed and agility, darting in and out of Liston's range with lightning-fast combinations. Liston, accustomed to dominating his opponents with brute force, found himself unable to land clean shots on the elusive Clay.
				As the rounds wore on, Clay's confidence only seemed to grow. He danced around the ring, taunting Liston with his footwork and taunts. And then, in the seventh round, the unthinkable happened. Liston, unable to continue due to a mysterious issue with his eyes, conceded defeat.
				In a stunning upset, Cassius Clay had dethroned the mighty Sonny Liston to claim the world heavyweight title. The boxing world was in shock, but for Clay, it was the culmination of years of hard work and dedication. With this victory, he announced himself to the world as not just a talented boxer, but a force to be reckoned with—a man destined for greatness.</p>
				<h4>1971: "Fight of the Century" against Joe Frazier</h4>
				<p>In 1971, the world of boxing witnessed a clash of titans as Muhammad Ali stepped into the ring against Joe Frazier in what would later be dubbed the "Fight of the Century." Anticipation hung thick in the air as these two undefeated heavyweight champions faced off at the hallowed grounds of Madison Square Garden.
				Ali, renowned for his unparalleled skill, charisma, and unyielding confidence, had returned to the ring after a forced hiatus due to his refusal to serve in the Vietnam War. Frazier, on the other hand, was a powerhouse of a fighter, known for his relentless aggression and thunderous left hook.
				From the opening bell, it was clear that this would be a battle for the ages. Ali danced and jabbed, using his speed and footwork to keep Frazier at bay, while Frazier relentlessly pursued, landing punishing blows whenever he could close the distance.
				The fight raged on for 15 grueling rounds, each one a testament to the indomitable will and skill of both fighters. Ali's trademark wit and showmanship were on full display, even as he absorbed punishing blows from Frazier's relentless assault.
				In the end, it was Frazier who emerged victorious, handing Ali his first professional loss in a closely contested decision. But despite the defeat, Ali's performance in the ring that night was nothing short of extraordinary. His resilience, courage, and determination to go the distance against a formidable opponent like Frazier solidified his status as a true warrior of the sport.</p>
				<h4>1974: The "Rumble in the Jungle" against George Foreman</h4>
				<p>In the aftermath of the "Fight of the Century," Muhammad Ali faced not only the physical toll of his first professional loss but also the psychological weight of defeat. Yet, true to his character, Ali refused to be defeated in spirit.
				Despite the disappointment of falling short against Joe Frazier, Ali displayed remarkable resilience and courage in the face of adversity. He took the loss as a lesson, a chance to learn and grow as a fighter. Ali knew that setbacks were merely stepping stones on the path to greatness.
				In the days and weeks following the fight, Ali retreated from the spotlight to reflect and strategize. He analyzed every aspect of his performance, identifying strengths to build upon and weaknesses to address. Ali was determined to come back stronger, to prove that he was more than just a flashy showman—he was a true champion.
				The loss to Frazier fueled Ali's competitive fire, igniting a burning desire to reclaim his status as the undisputed king of the heavyweight division. It set the stage for a fierce rivalry that would define an era of boxing.
				Ali's resilience in the face of defeat served as an inspiration to countless fans around the world. He showed that true champions are not measured by their wins alone but by their ability to rise again after falling. And rise again, Ali did.</p>
				<h4>1975: The "Thrilla in Manila" against Joe Frazier</h4>
				<p>In the scorching heat of Manila, in 1975, Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier faced off in what would become one of the most legendary fights in boxing history—the "Thrilla in Manila." This bout was not just a clash of two heavyweight champions; it was the culmination of a bitter rivalry that had captivated the world.
				By the time of their third meeting, Ali and Frazier were more than just opponents; they were bitter adversaries, each seeking to assert their dominance over the other. The stakes were high, and the tension between them was palpable as they stepped into the ring for the final chapter of their epic trilogy.
				From the opening bell, it was clear that this would be a battle for the ages. Both fighters unleashed a relentless barrage of punches, each refusing to give an inch to the other. The sweltering heat only added to the intensity of the contest, pushing both men to their physical limits.
				As the rounds wore on, Ali and Frazier traded blow for blow, neither willing to back down. The relentless pace of the fight took its toll on both fighters, but still, they pressed on, fueled by sheer determination and the desire to emerge victorious.
				In the end, it was Ali who emerged triumphant. In the 14th round, sensing that Frazier was on the brink of collapse, Frazier's corner made the difficult decision to throw in the towel, conceding defeat and handing Ali the victory.
				The "Thrilla in Manila" was more than just a boxing match; it was a test of wills, a battle of courage and resilience. And in the searing heat of that Manila night, Muhammad Ali proved once again why he was the greatest. His victory not only cemented his supremacy in the rivalry with Frazier but also solidified his place in boxing history as one of the all-time greats.
				But beyond the glory of victory, the "Thrilla in Manila" took a toll on both fighters, physically and emotionally. It was a brutal contest that pushed them to their limits and left an indelible mark on their lives and careers.</p>
				<h4>1978: Becoming the First Three-Time Heavyweight Champion</h4>
				<p>In 1978, Muhammad Ali etched his name even deeper into the annals of boxing history by achieving a feat no other fighter had accomplished before—becoming the first three-time heavyweight champion of the world. His journey to this unprecedented achievement culminated in a showdown with the formidable Leon Spinks.
				Ali, already a legend in the sport, had faced numerous challenges and triumphs throughout his storied career. But the opportunity to reclaim the heavyweight title for a third time presented a unique and daunting challenge.
				In the ring with Leon Spinks, a young and hungry contender, Ali faced a formidable opponent determined to make a name for himself by defeating the legendary champion. But Ali, drawing upon his wealth of experience, skill, and unwavering determination, rose to the occasion with characteristic grace and tenacity.
				The fight was a fierce battle, with both fighters exchanging punishing blows in a display of skill and courage. But as the rounds wore on, it became clear that Ali's experience and ring savvy were beginning to tip the scales in his favor.
				In a performance that showcased his resilience and tactical brilliance, Ali outmaneuvered and outclassed Spinks, asserting his dominance in the ring and ultimately emerging victorious.</p>
				<h4>1967: Refusing Military Induction</h4>
				<p>Ali's decision to refuse induction into the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War was a watershed moment not only in his boxing career but also in the broader cultural and political landscape of the 1960s.
				At the time of his refusal, the Vietnam War was a deeply divisive issue in the United States, with many young Americans protesting against what they saw as an unjust and imperialistic conflict. Ali's outspoken opposition to the war, coupled with his assertion of conscientious objection based on his religious beliefs as a practicing Muslim, immediately thrust him into the national spotlight.
				His refusal to serve in the military was met with a mixture of admiration and condemnation. While some hailed him as a hero for standing up for his principles and refusing to participate in what he deemed an immoral war, others vilified him as a draft dodger and unpatriotic.
				The repercussions of Ali's decision were swift and severe. In 1967, he was convicted of draft evasion, fined $10,000, and sentenced to five years in prison. Additionally, the boxing authorities stripped him of his titles, including his prestigious heavyweight championship, and suspended his boxing license, effectively banning him from competing in the sport.
				Ali's exile from boxing during his prime years was a significant blow not only to his career but also to the sport itself. He was at the peak of his powers, with his boxing prowess and charismatic personality captivating audiences around the world. His absence left a void in the heavyweight division and deprived fans of witnessing one of the greatest athletes of all time in action.
				However, Ali's exile from boxing did not diminish his impact. On the contrary, it further elevated his status as a symbol of resistance and defiance against injustice. He became a rallying point for the anti-war movement and a voice of conscience in a turbulent era marked by social upheaval and civil unrest.</p>
				<h4>Charismatic and Poetic Trash Talk</h4>
				<p>Ali's verbal dexterity and gift for self-promotion were unparalleled in the world of sports. He had a unique ability to entertain and captivate audiences with his clever rhymes, sharp wit, and unapologetic bravado. Whether he was predicting the round in which he would knock out his opponent or taunting them with clever insults, Ali's trash-talking added an extra layer of excitement and drama to his fights.
				His rhymes were often humorous, provocative, and razor-sharp, earning him the nickname "The Louisville Lip." Ali used his gift for gab not only to psych out his opponents but also to draw attention to himself and his fights, turning each bout into a spectacle that transcended the sport of boxing.
				Ali's trash-talking was more than just bravado; it was a strategic tool that he used to gain a psychological advantage over his opponents. By getting inside their heads and undermining their confidence, Ali could often dictate the pace and outcome of a fight before even stepping into the ring.
				Beyond the boxing ring, Ali's trash-talking helped to cement his status as a larger-than-life cultural icon. His memorable one-liners and quotable quotes became part of the popular lexicon, and his confident swagger inspired countless athletes and entertainers.
				However, Ali's trash-talking was always backed up by his incredible skill and athleticism inside the ring. He was more than just talk; he was a supremely talented boxer who used his wit and charisma to enhance his legacy as one of the greatest athletes of all time..</p>
				<h4>Civil Rights and Activism</h4>
				<p>Beyond boxing, Ali was a vocal advocate for civil rights, racial equality, and religious freedom, using his platform to champion social justice causes.</p>
				<h4>Legacy and Cultural Impact</h4>
				<p>Ali's influence extends far beyond the boxing ring; he is revered as a cultural icon, humanitarian, and symbol of resilience and courage worldwide.</p>
