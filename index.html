			<h1> BIO</h1>
			<p>Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky, was much more than just a boxer; he was a global icon who transcended his sport to become a symbol of courage, resilience, and social justice. In boxing, Ali's accomplishments are legendary.
			</p>
			<h1> Boxing resume</h1>
			<p> He won the Olympic gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Rome Olympics, marking the beginning of a remarkable career. Known for his dazzling footwork, lightning-fast punches, and unparalleled charisma, Ali became a three-time heavyweight champion of the world, capturing the title in 1964, 1974, and 1978. His epic battles in the ring against formidable opponents like Sonny Liston, Joe Frazier, and George Foreman are etched into the annals of boxing history.</p>
			<h1> Social life</h1>
			<p>
			Beyond his athletic prowess, Ali was a fearless advocate for civil rights and social justice. He famously embraced the Nation of Islam and changed his name, challenging the racial and religious norms of his time. Ali's refusal to be drafted into the Vietnam War on religious and moral grounds made him a lightning rod for controversy but also solidified his status as a symbol of resistance and defiance against injustice. His conviction led to a temporary ban from boxing and the loss of his heavyweight title, yet he stood firm in his principles, famously declaring, "I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong."

			Ali's impact extended far beyond the realm of sports and activism. He was a poet, philosopher, and humanitarian whose words and actions inspired millions around the world. His famous quotes, such as "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee" and "Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth," resonate with people of all backgrounds to this day.

			In his later years, Ali battled Parkinson's disease with the same grace and dignity that he exhibited throughout his life, becoming a symbol of perseverance in the face of adversity.</p>
			<h1> Take away</h1>
			<p>Muhammad Ali's legacy is not just confined to the boxing ring; it is a testament to the power of one individual to effect change, challenge injustice, and inspire generations to come. He remains an enduring symbol of courage, principle, and the relentless pursuit of greatness.</div>
