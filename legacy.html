		<h3>Boxing career</h3>
		<p>Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky, rose to prominence as one of the most celebrated athletes of the 20th century. His journey in boxing began at a young age, guided by a combination of natural talent, relentless dedication, and unwavering determination.
		Ali's boxing career was nothing short of legendary, characterized by unparalleled success, remarkable agility, and an undeniable charisma that captured the hearts and imaginations of people worldwide. His remarkable ascent to fame culminated in a gold medal victory at the 1960 Rome Olympics, where he showcased his extraordinary skills and announced his arrival on the international stage.
		Following his Olympic triumph, Ali embarked on a professional boxing career that would redefine the sport. With his lightning-fast footwork, lightning-quick jabs, and unorthodox fighting style, he became known for his mesmerizing performances inside the ring. Ali's matches were not just boxing bouts; they were spectacles, filled with drama, excitement, and unforgettable moments.
		Ali's crowning achievement came when he claimed the heavyweight title not once, not twice, but three times throughout his illustrious career. His epic battles against formidable opponents such as Sonny Liston, Joe Frazier, and George Foreman are etched into the annals of boxing history. Each fight was a testament to Ali's skill, resilience, and unwavering determination to emerge victorious.</p>

			<h3>Activism and civil rights</h3>
			<p>Muhammad Ali's commitment to civil rights and activism went beyond his role as a boxer; it was deeply rooted in his personal beliefs and experiences. Growing up in a racially segregated America, Ali witnessed firsthand the injustices faced by African Americans, which fueled his passion for social justice.

He was unafraid to challenge societal norms and confront racism head-on, both inside and outside the boxing ring. His outspokenness and courage made him a prominent figure in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.
			One of Ali's most significant acts of resistance was his refusal to be drafted into the military during the Vietnam War. Citing his Muslim faith and opposition to the war on moral grounds, Ali famously declared, "I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong." This decision led to a highly publicized legal battle, resulting in his temporary exile from boxing and the stripping of his heavyweight title.
			Despite facing backlash, condemnation, and even threats to his livelihood and freedom, Ali remained steadfast in his convictions. His refusal to compromise his principles resonated with millions around the world, inspiring them to stand up against injustice and oppression.
			Ali's stance against the Vietnam War and his willingness to sacrifice his boxing career for his beliefs elevated him to the status of a global icon of resistance and defiance. His legacy as a civil rights activist continues to inspire generations, serving as a reminder of the power of individuals to effect change and fight for justice, even in the face of adversity.</p>
