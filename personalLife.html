				<p>Muhammad Ali's personal life was as colorful and eventful as his legendary boxing career. Here are some key aspects of his personal life:</p>
				<h4>Early Life and Childhood</h4>
				<p>Muhammad Ali was born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky, USA. He grew up in a predominantly African American neighborhood and began boxing at the age of 12 after his bicycle was stolen and he expressed a desire to "whup" the thief.</p>
				<h4>Conversion to Islam</h4>
				<p>In 1964, Clay announced his conversion to Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali, which he described as his "free name." He joined the Nation of Islam and became a devout Muslim, adopting the teachings and practices of the faith.</p>
				<h4>Family Life</h4>
				<p>Ali was married four times and had a total of nine children. His most well-known marriage was to his third wife, Veronica Porsche Ali, whom he married in 1977. They had two daughters together. Ali was also known for his close relationship with his children and grandchildren.</p>
				<h4>Health Challenges</h4>
				<p>In the later years of his life, Ali faced health challenges, including Parkinson's disease, which was diagnosed in 1984. Despite his declining health, Ali remained active in public life, advocating for Parkinson's research and participating in charitable activities.</p>
				<h4>Philanthropy and Humanitarian Work</h4>
				<p>Ali was known for his philanthropic efforts and humanitarian work. He supported various charitable organizations and causes, including children's hospitals, humanitarian aid projects, and educational initiatives. He was particularly involved in promoting peace and understanding between different cultures and religions.</p>
				<h4>Legacy and Impact: </h4>
				<p>Ali's personal life, marked by his faith, his relationships, and his struggles with health issues, reflects the complexities of his character and the depth of his humanity. His legacy extends beyond his achievements in the boxing ring to encompass his role as a cultural icon, a symbol of resilience and courage, and a champion for social justice and equality.</p>
